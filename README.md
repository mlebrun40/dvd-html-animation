# DVD Animation in HTML/CSS/JS
This project is a simple implementation of the classic DVD screensaver animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation features a DVD logo bouncing around the screen, changing direction when it hits the edges.
## Features
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Smooth animation using CSS transitions
- Customizable DVD logo
- Simple and clean code structure
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mlebrun40/dvd-html-animation.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
## Usage
- The DVD logo will start bouncing around the screen automatically.
- You can customize the logo by replacing the `dvd-logo.png` file in the `images` directory with your own image.
